## Future Development (E-commerce Roadmap)

The next phase of development will focus on integrating e-commerce functionality. The following is a proposed phased approach:

### Phase 1: External Marketplace Integration

*   **Goal:** Allow customers to purchase products immediately through existing, trusted platforms.
*   **Action:** Add "Buy on Shopee" and "Buy on Lazada" buttons to each product card in "The Collection" section. These buttons will link directly to the corresponding product pages on those marketplaces.

### Phase 2: Social & Direct Messaging Integration

*   **Goal:** Capture sales from social media and direct customer inquiries.
*   **Action:**
    *   Integrate with WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram catalogs.
    *   Add an "Order via WhatsApp" button that pre-fills a message with the product name, making it easy for customers to inquire or order.

### Phase 3: On-site E-commerce Solution

*   **Goal:** Create a fully-owned and branded shopping experience to maximize control and profit margins.
*   **Action:**
    *   **Option A (Lean):** Integrate a "Buy Button" solution (like Shopify Lite) to add a shopping cart and checkout directly onto the existing website.
    *   **Option B (Full-scale):** Develop a complete, dedicated e-commerce section on the website, potentially using a platform like Shopify, WooCommerce, or a custom solution. This would provide the most robust and scalable long-term platform.
